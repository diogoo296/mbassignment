# MBAssignment

MessageBird Backend Assignment: a simple API that uses MessageBird API to send SMSes.

## Getting Started

Before anything else, please install or check the current installed version of *Golang* (**>=1.7.4**) and make sure it follows the code organization [described at Golang website](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#Organization).

Now clone this project and install its single dependency (**go-rest-api**):
```
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com
git clone git@bitbucket.org:diogo296/mbassignment.git
cd diogo296/mbassignment
go get github.com/messagebird/go-rest-api
```

Setup your MessageBird API access key in the file *config.json* as the example below, where the *development* key corresponds to the *Mode test* MessageBird key and the *production key* is the *Mode live* key. Notice that it's not required to setup both keys, but the application will not work properly if it's running in a environment with the correspondent key not set.
```
{
  "MbApiKey": {
    "development": <YOUR_TEST_API_KEY>,
    "production": <YOUR_LIVE_API_KEY>
  }
}
```

At last, build the project by typing the command `go build`, which will generate the bynary file `mbassignment`.

## How to run it

Simply type `./mbassignment` to run the binary generated by the build in your terminal with. If the project is running properly, you will see a message like this one:
```
2017/09/17 10:56:01 ENV: development
2017/09/17 10:56:01 Server started!
```

The server will run by default in the development environment and thus use MessageBird API test key. To use the live key, please run the API with the *production environment variable*:
```
ENV=producion ./mbassignment
2017/09/17 10:57:10 ENV: production
2017/09/17 10:57:10 Server started!
```

Notice that the application will run in the *development environment* for any `ENV` parameter different from *production*.

## How it works

This API has a single route, `/messages`, which makes a **POST** request to MessageBird API at the URI `https://rest.messagebird.com/messages`. This route expects a json payload with the following parameters:

| Parameter  | Type   | Description |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| recipient  | string | The recipient msisdn. **Required**. |
| originator | string | The sender of the message. This can be a telephone number (including country code) or an alphanumeric string. In case of an alphanumeric string, the maximum length is 11 characters. **Required**. |
| message    | string | The body of the SMS message. Can be composed by either GSM 03.38 characters or unicode characters. **Required**. |

Here is an example of a *curl* request to a running server instance of this API:
```
curl -X POST https://localhost:8080/messages \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{"recipient":"31612345678", "originator":"YourName", "body": "Test message"}'
```
A successful request should receive as a response a MessageBird message object like the one below:
```
[{"Id":"5e404e4fef8249da98bdd5cfcc0ce2d6","HRef":"https://rest.messagebird.com/messages/5e404e4fef8249da98bdd5cfcc0ce2d6","Direction":"mt","Type":"sms","Originator":"YourName","Body":"Test message","Reference":"","Validity":null,"Gateway":10,"TypeDetails":{},"DataCoding":"plain","MClass":1,"ScheduledDatetime":null,"CreatedDatetime":"2017-09-17T14:42:30Z","Recipients":{"TotalCount":1,"TotalSentCount":1,"TotalDeliveredCount":0,"TotalDeliveryFailedCount":0,"Items":[{"Recipient":31612345678,"Status":"sent","StatusDatetime":"2017-09-17T14:42:30Z"}]},"Errors":null}]
```

## Characters and message length

Considering the concatenated SMS limitations and differences between GSM 03.38 characters and unicode characters, the number of messages sent follows the table described [in this article](https://support.messagebird.com/hc/en-us/articles/208739745-How-long-is-1-SMS-Message-).

For more about GSM 03.38 characters and which ones from this set counts as 2 characters in a message, check out [this article](https://support.messagebird.com/hc/en-us/articles/208739765-Which-special-characters-count-as-two-characters-in-a-text-message-).

## Known issues

* **Concatenated unicode messages:** Even though the SMS UDH seems correct and the message parts respect the maximum size, the concatenated messages are not showing as a single message in the phone when the characters are unicode.
